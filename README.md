# Numerical Programming in Python
On successful completion of this module, students will be able to:
1.	Design reproducible code to solve numerical problems using the Python programming language.
2.	Compare algorithms based on their theoretical and practical properties, and select appropriately.
3.	Identify and correct different sources of error in numerical code and find ways to test for them.
4.	Analyse and interpret earth science problems using numerical codes.

## Module Content

The module will include cover the following topics:
1.	Students will be taught how to program in Python and how to use a range of Python modules to perform compute-intensive and data-intensive tasks. 
2.	Debugging and validation techniques to identify errors in code and prove that algorithms will operate correctly.
3.	A discussion of fundamentals of algorithmic analysis, with concrete examples chosen for their relevance to data processing.
4.	A discussion of the techniques used to finitely represent numbers in computer programs and the possible errors this can introduce.
